# Port-Scanner
A Port Scanner that is able to scan the open ports of your device automatically and gives you the option to manually scan a URL as well.

The Zip folder attached contains the code of the Port Scanner that is programmed in **Python** (for purposes such as download the entire project) and it also contains a report explaining the code, testing it and changes that happened throughout the programming of the Port Scanner.

The code files are also attached seperatley (the file codes that can be found on the Zip File) in case you want to view only one code file.

This work was done by **Renato Dushku** only as a part of a university assigment.

**Grade obtained: 2.1 High**
